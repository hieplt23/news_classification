## Introduction

This project leverages machine learning to predict article genres from vnexpress.net, a leading Vietnamese news portal. The methodology encompasses data extraction, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization across 9 algorithms. Hyperparameter tuning is employed to identify the most suitable model. The culmination is a web application that visualizes predictions, demonstrating practical application of NLP techniques in content categorization.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of articles spanning various fields and is divided into 6 attributes:
- Title
- Abstract
- Content
- Author
- Date
- Label

**Location**: `./data/vnexpress_data.csv`

## Categories

## Methodology

### Trained Models

Nine machine learning models were utilized, chosen for their suitability to the problem:

1. LogisticRegression
2. MultinomialNB
3. BaggingClassifier
4. DecisionTreeClassifier
5. LinearSVC
6. SGDClassifier
7. KNeighborsClassifier
8. RandomForestClassifier
9. GradientBoostingClassifier

### Training Process

- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing
- Feature extraction: TFIDF

## Results

### Initial Model Performance
